# All Information About This Repository

- First actual project made with HTML and CSS. I'm kind of a beginner so feel free to give some feedback so I can improve this more and more.
- First version completed in an hour or two.
- I spent like the entire day redoing this website lol!

# What I have so far (definitely subject to change)

So far I have a total of 2 pages, which are:

- Home (index.html)
- Ned (ned.html)

# Changelog

- Added (and also fixed) social links at the bottom of the page. | 4/29/21
- I completely redid the website; I replaced useless things in home page with information about me, added a page for ned, and removed all Discord bot pages. | 5/30/22

# Conclusion

- Overall, I am a beginner at HTML and CSS, so I hope to learn more in the future. I completely redid the website over a year after it was published here on Github.
- I guess feedback and stuff would be appreciated :)
