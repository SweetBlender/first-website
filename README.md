# first-website
- First actual project made with HTML and CSS. I'm kind of a beginner so feel free to give some feedback so I can improve this more and more.
- Very very simple website I made in like 1 - 2 hours.

# What I have so far (definitely subject to change)
So far I have a total of 3 pages, which are:

- Home (index.html)
- 9 + 10 Bot Invite Page (Bot by Zylly - aka me)
- Poop Bot Invite Page (Bot by Morphizn, credit to them)

# Conclusion
As I have mentioned earlier I am quite new to this (still, since I barely learnt much about html in school), and I am still learning more and more. Again, feedback is appreciated and I hope to improve this site. :)
